                  <p>To better comprehend how the C compiler I use everyday works, I built my own version. 
                     The project is well over four thousand lines of code that I have written. There are 
                     also numerous other files with code that was used to assist this project. Below you 
                     will find just the smallest summary of what the project looked like.</p>

                     <h3 >Regular expressions</h3>
                     <p>I used flex to simplify the process in finding reqular expressions. <br>
                        You can look at all the regular expressions <a href="code/parser.l"> here.</a> </p>

                  <div class="column-text">
                     <h3>Grammar rules</h3>
                     <p>Bison was used for the grammar rules that made up this language. The grammar I 
                        was trying to recreate was not ambigious and takles the dangling else problem. <br>
                           ou can take a look at the whole file <a href="code/parser.y"> here.</a> </p>

                     <p>As the code was being parsed, I was bulding a tree to link all the critical dta found by the parsing.<br>
                        You can see what a tree node looks like <a href="code/printtree.h"> here </a></p>

                     <h3>Semantic analysis</h3>
                     <p>After I built the tree, I used it for type checking and other context errors. Some debugging features were also added. There are several flags 
                        that can be set to trigger a visual print of the tree with or without types and an explicit grammar walkthrough.<br> 
                        The visual tree code is <a href="code/printtree.c" > here.</a>

                     <h3>Memory allocation</h3>
                     <p>Once a tree is confirmed to have no erros, the program begins assigning memory usage for each node. Most nodes used one spot in memory but arrays 
                        used one more than their given size. Then I built frames around each function for its place in memory. Now to generate the code that was going to be read by a
                        machine, I just needed to look at the memory sizes, their offsets and provide the proper sequence of LD, ADD, ST and backpatches. <br>Some 
                        of that code can be found<a href="code/codeGen.c"> here. </a></p>

                        This was my first large project. A deeper understanign of each part would have made for more efficient code, especially in my
                        error checking and analysis. The code colud also use more comments in some places but the size of the project forced me to 
                        better that skill while I was working on it. A majority of this project was new concepts for me. I had never written extensive tree code
                        linked from flex and bison and I had done little assembly code. I was able to get through most of my issues (grammar rules, regular expression 
                        oddities and ID types to name a few) leading to a working product but it is not everything I planned for. The final code has trouble 
                        with arrays in particual and a range of obvious edge cases. I am happy with what I have learned from it and have no plans to fix those 
                        bugs in the near future.

               <p style="padding:10px; text-align: justify;">This project uses a database to suggest classes for a computer science student based on their career intrests. New users add themsleves to the database with the add keyword followed by their name, student ID and industy they are intrested in.
                  They can use keywords to add classes they have taken and get semester specific class recomendations based on previously taken courses.
                  At any point a user can return to the page and place their ID in the corner to continue using the software. They can also access the list 
                  of all classes as well as the classes they have completed. </p>

               <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: justify;"> <br>This was my first experience with a live database. I am happy with how the project finished but it took a lot of patience and 
                  learning to get it there. Setting everything up to work together was a frustrating experience and I deleted my database on accident 
                  on multiple occasions. It is a sobering experince to find all data gone because I was trying to solve a connection issue but it taught me
                  a valuable lesson in file backups.

                  <p>This project is early practice of a stack data structure. The program reads in a maze file built from a matrix of periods 
                  represnting open cells, hashes for closed cells and S for start G for goal. The c++ program then pushes available cells
                  on a stack and pushes coordnates off when it runs out of cells to push. The program finishes when it finds its goal or runs out of
                  possible cells. </p>

                  <p>I have returned to this code of several occasions to play with it. I first added a print function within the solution loop
                     this allows for a visible walkthrough of the algorithm. It was difficult to see the visited cells so I added colors for a 
                     stronger visual. The last addition I made was an alias to run the three above mazes.
