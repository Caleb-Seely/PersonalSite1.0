# PersonalSite1.0
The hot dumpster fire that was my first attempt at a personal website. CSS is a pain to do by hand.

After about a month of consistent work, I had made engough progress to call it a website. The page had too many bugs both big and small and evry little change would ruin any attempt I made of formatting. 

After taking some extended time off of the project as school took over, I returned to find it as messy and chaotic as I had left it...how strange.
This repository is partly for storage partly to show growth for future websites. 

I decided to take the design elements I enjoyed and applied them to an improved page, this time using bootstrap 4 to do all the heavy lifting.
